The website and the FAQ section tries to answer possible doubts about the test and the data. Do you have more and would you like to talk about them or about found issues? You can register in this doodle: [Q&A session about the GeoBIM benchmark](https://doodle.com/poll/fz6a6vvvz3dft5g9) If a few people are interested, the session will be hold on 3rd October 2019 h.10.00-11.00 CET via web (we will publish the link to join).

<h3>Reference study on software support for open standards of city and building models</h3>

This benchmark investigated the available **technical solutions** to support research and activities related to GeoBIM, through the use of the **open standards IFC** (by buildingSMART) and **CityGML** (by OGC):

.

<h4>1. What is the <strong>support for IFC</strong> within BIM (and other) software?</h4>

<h4>2. What options for <strong>geo-referencing BIM</strong> data are available?</h4>

<h4>3. What is the <strong>support for CityGML</strong> within GIS (and other) tools?</h4>

<h4>4. What options for <strong>conversion (IFCâ†”CityGML)</strong> are available?</h4>
.

The final **Results** of the project can be accessed at the [presentations&publications](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim-benchmark/presentations-publications.html) page of this website, as well as all the resulting datasets.
