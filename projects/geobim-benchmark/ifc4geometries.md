## Short description

Set of geometries to test specific geometric features in software in IFC4.

It was modelled specifically for this study by T. Krijnen.

It was exported on 13/03/2019 using IfcOpenShell 0.6

In Figure 1 the schema of the geometries is drawn as reference

## Technical details

Name of the file: <strong>IFC4geometries.ifc</strong>

Used IFC version:  **4**

------------------

You can check their characteristics in the following images. They derive from different software (Solibri model viewer and FZK viewer), since different software read them differently.

Therefore, while making task 1, describe them as they appear in the tested software, and don't be influenced by the images that you see here.

In Figure 3, the red and green surfaces are mapping the normals directions of the surfaces, indicatively.
