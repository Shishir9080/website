<h1>Benchmark events</h1>

Within the GeoBIM benchmark initiative, two open events are about to be organised:

A meeting (also web-meeting) between organisers and participants together for discussing the issues arose so far and proposing improvements to the materials and the on-going activities.

A winter school for presenting the main results and training to GeoBIM.

## EuroSDR - AMS GeoBIM benchmark workshop

*Please, note that this is not an ISPRS event, although part of the research presented in the workshop are results of the GeoBIM benchmark, funded as Scientific initiative by ISPRS and co-funded by EuroSDR.*

The GeoBIM benchmark workshop will be held on next **December 2nd/3rd** to get insight into the **GeoBIM benchmark results** and explore in detail the **related topics**:

- 3D city models,
- Building Information Models,
- respective open standards (CityGML, CityJSON, IFC, and more),
- GeoBIM use cases (automatic building permission issuing, asset management, energy simulations).

### Workshop details:

***When***: 2nd/3rd December 2019
