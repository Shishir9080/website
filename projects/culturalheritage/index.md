## Summary

The relationship between the cultural value of architectural heritage and its spatial features is straightforward.

3D spatial information systems are very effective to store such information and to support its analysis.

Mainly two approaches are proposed by literature, notwithstanding the still existing challenges, and their integration is a powerful opportunity:

- the Heritage Building Information Models (HBIMs)

- or the archiving of the information in 3D city models.


Many related issued need are object of study:

1) How to suitably represent architectural heritage and historical cities in 3D city models?

- What are the different needs for the cultural heritage representation in cities, in connection to the related use cases?
- What information should be in each level of detail?
- How to suitably generalise architectural models?
- How can GIS tools and methods better support preservation?

2) How the information from HBIM can integrate the representation of architectural heritage and historical cities?

- How to use heritage GeoBIM for managing cultural heritage (maintenance, tourism and safety, preservation, historical and artistical analysis)?
