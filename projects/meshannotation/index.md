## Summary
Recent advances in Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) enable generating textured meshes of large scale urban scenes. Many real-world applications (e.g., sunlight simulation) require detailed semantic information of these models. With the current state-of-the-art machine learning / deep learning techniques, it is possible to perform semantic segmentation on urban meshes with the feeding of large annotated data sets. 

The project aims to build benchmark data sets for semantic 3D urban meshes and a mesh annotation platform.
