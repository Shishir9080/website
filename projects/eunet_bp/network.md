**People**

[***Francesca Noardo***](http://www.noardo.eu)

She is postdoc in the 3D Geoinformation group - TU Delft and research fellow in the [Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions](https://www.ams-institute.org/member/francesca-noardo/).
Her current research mainly regards the integration of multi-source spatial data, in particular, detailed 3D models (from survey or from design), in interoperable 3D maps, having semantics from open standards and correct geometry. She has an MSc degree in Architecture (Restoration and Enhancement) (2012) and PhD in Cultural Heritage, developed in the geomatics field (2016) from the Politecnico di Torino (Italy).
She led the projects ['EuroSDR GeoBIM'](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/eurosdr-geobim/) and the ['ISPRS-EuroSDR GeoBIM benchmark'](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim-benchmark/). She is the secretary in the [ISPRS Working Group IV/2: Ontologies, Semantics, and Knowledge Representation for Geospatial Information](http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm4/wg2.html).


[***Jantien Stoter***](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/jstoter/)

Prof dr Jantien Stoter is full professor in 3D Geoinformation, at Department of Urbanism. Jantien’s research interests are 3D
geo-data technologies for urban applications, automated generalisation, geospatial information modeling and the integration of Geo and BIM. She obtained her PhD degree (3DCadastre) in 2004, which was awared with the Tienstra award (Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences). For her research on 5D data modeling she received the prestigious Vidi award of the Netherlands Scientific Foundation (NWO). She also received a Starting Grant from the
European Research Council for her proposal Urban Modeling in higher dimensions. Jantien combines her profesorship with jobs as researcher at both the Kadaster and Geonovum. She is also a Principal Investigator at the AMS
and vice-chair of the 3D Information Management Domain WG of the OGC.

### Municipality of Rotterdam - Team Digital City & Department of building and housing supervision. Rotterdam (The Netherlands)

<!--
***What are our interest in the Digital Building Permission project***

Due to huge shortages in the housing market the city of Rotterdam the city has an important task to realize new homes faster.
Shortening the time spent on the licensing process is a good development for both the municipality and the developers.
Our experts can focus more on the more important issues by making certain checks automatically.

***Our expertises on the table for the project***

Consulting and questioning all types of specialists and experts who perform the entire range of tests, including outside inspectors and inspectors.
