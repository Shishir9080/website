# Participants

## Research Institutes

### [3D Geoinformation - Delft University of Technology. Delft (The Netherlands)](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl)

Expert in 3D city models and related standards (CityGML, CityJSON...); GeoBIM and spatial data integration; Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard; BIM (in particular: geometry representation and validation).

Working for the integration of 3D (geo)information systems for use cases, through open standards and open (and F.A.I.R.) technologies.

### Fraunhofer Italia Research (Italy)

Experts in BIM implementation in public administration; BIM requirements analysis to accomplish the building permit procedure; Statistical content/information/data analysis of building permit documentation; BIM asset development for public administration.

Working for the integration of BIM models and geographic information system to facilitate the building permit evaluation process and to promote the digital transformation in small Municipalities.

### Università di Brescia (Italy)

Expert in BIM implementation in public administration for exchange information requirements, model and code checking; BIM-enabled design management; building energy modelling and IoT-based asset management, procedural aspects of virtual reality implementation in collaborative design reviews; IoT-enabled construction management.

Working for the integration of BIM and IoT systems for use cases for public administrations and SME construction companies to promote digital innovation in process engineering.

### University of Ljubljana (Slovenia)

The team from the Chair of geoinformatics has competences in GIS data and processes modelling (using standards such as UML), 3D geospatial data modelling by integrating various data sources, real property information systems and geospatial data support for decision making.
 
Working for 3D-geospatial data and processes modelling, including the integration of BIM models and geographic information system, to facilitate the whole process from building permit issuing to cadastral registration.


### Lund University (Sweden)

### HafenCity Universität Hamburg (D)

### University College London (UK)

GeoBIM research focusses on full lifecycle modelling – including: reality capture and sensor enabling for new and existing buildings and infrastructure; the use of geospatial data for planning and construction site safety and management; data management standards and protocols for handover from construction to operational building phases; the use of geoBIM for facilities and asset management.  The role of geospatial (location-enabled data from BIM, GIS or other sources) as an underpinning integrator  is  seen as key in order to enable interoperability of sensor data, demographics, traffic information, pedestrian movement data and so forth, all required to facilitate smart city operation and decision making.

### Institute of Construction Management and Digital Engineering (ICoM) (D)

The Institute of Construction Management and Digital Engineering (ICoM) resides in the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geodesy at Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany. There are four main research and working group topics at the ICoM: Methodologies and digital solutions in the AEC sector (e.g. process optimization, VR/AR applications, intelligent modelling and model automatization), management of major projects (e.g. reduction of multidimensional complexity with digital solutions, resilient infrastructure systems), digital construction (e.g. integrative fabrication, qualification approaches, generative fabrication). Coordinating the “Masterplan BIM for research” (funded by Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community, Germany) and is involved in various activities with other federal ministries.  
 
ICoM has various research projects running and is executing digital respectively BIM-based approaches in all life cycle phases of buildings and all modes of ground infrastructure. Funded by the Niedersachsen Ministry of Economic Affairs, Employment, Transport and Digitalisation, ICoM develops a model-based digital building permit for the state (project runtime: 1.1.2020-31.12.2020.) It is part of the buildingSMART network and heads the BIM-Cluster in the state of Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen).

## Governmental Institutions

### Municipality of Rotterdam - Team Digital City & Department of building and housing supervision. Rotterdam (The Netherlands)

All types of specialists and experts who perform the entire range of tests for Building Permits, including outside inspectors and inspectors. And Digital city experts.

Working for shortening the time spent on the licensing process, which is a good development for both the municipality and the developers. The experts can focus more on the more important issues by making certain checks automatically.

### [Institut Cartogràfic i Geològic de Catalunya (ICGC) (Catalunya)](https://www.icgc.cat/en/)

The Institut Cartogràfic i Geològic de Catalunya (ICGC) has competences on Geodesy, Cartography and Spatial Data Infrastructure of Catalonia, and also on the actions related to the awareness, survey and provide information about the soil and subsoil. Related to GeoBIM, the main interest is to warranty the interoperability between BIM data produced by the Catalan Government and GIS data produced and updated by ICGC, and to ensure that workflows where both data are required, as Building Permit Procedure, can be successfully implemented and executed.

### [Estonian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications (Estonia)](https://mkm.ee/en/objectives-activities/construction-and-housing-sector)

The objective of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications is to provide a suitable legislative, economic and safe environment that fosters the development of the Estonian construction and housing sector ensured by efficient legislative drafting, standardisation and support programmes. The ministry is developing the e-construction platform to connect data and services related to the built environment. This includes a fully digital building permit process for the whole of Estonia. A BIM-based building permit process will be launched in 2021.
