Shenglan Du and Ivan PaÄ‘en have just joined our research group as PhD students, and Jordi van Liempt as a researcher.

Shenglan's interests involve machine learning, urban modeling, and 3D geodata analysis, and 3D understanding. She will be working on 3D understanding and modeling based on AI, part of the [3DUU lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ai/3duu/).

After having graduated from the MSc Geomatics of TU Delft, Jordi has been appointed to the 3D geoinformation group for five months as a researcher. He is focusing on the alignment of 3D data of several organisations (e.g. municipalities) with 3D data from Kadaster and subsequent integration. He has also previously worked here as a student assistent with the [GeoBIM benchmark project](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim-benchmark/).

Ivan has a master's degree in aeronautical engineering from the University of Zagreb, Croatia. Upon graduating, he worked there as a research associate on numerical modeling of multiphase flows. His PhD topic focuses on the automation of urban flow simulations with 3D city models.

Welcome Ivan, Jordi, and Shenglan, and good luck!
