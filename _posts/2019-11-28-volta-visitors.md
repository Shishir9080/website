We had a wonderful time hosting some [VOLTA](https://volta.fbk.eu/) visitors for their secondments during October and November. We also learned a lot!

We had Iuliana Cuibac from [Centrul National de Cartografie](https://www.cngcft.ro/index.php/en/), Romania, and Bernhard Schachinger from [Vexcel Imaging](https://www.vexcel-imaging.com/), Austria.

Both experimented with utilising our software with their data. Iuliana utilised [3dfier](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3dfier), CityJSON/[cjio](https://github.com/cityjson/cjio), and [Geoflow](https://github.com/geoflow3d). Bernhard looked at [Polyfit](https://github.com/LiangliangNan/PolyFit) and investigated the business opportunities in 3D city models.
