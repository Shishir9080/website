Want to have some fun? Why not try [Easy3D](https://github.com/LiangliangNan/Easy3D)??? Easy3D is an open-source library for 3D modeling, geometry processing, and rendering. It is implemented in C++ and designed with an emphasis on simplicity and efficiency.

Easy3D is intended for research, educational purposes, and it's also a good starting point for developing sophisticated 3D applications, but you can also have fun with it! 

Easy3D can now also generate 3D models of texts (using any closed font)! Check out the samples below:
