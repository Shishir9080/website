We presented at the FOSS4G 2019 conference in Bucharest:

**Working with 3D city models in Python**

Semantic 3D city models are one of the cornerstones of the so-called "smart city" applications, yet they are very difficult to manipulate/edit/update. While they are relatively easy to generate, their use and maintenance is limited by the available software and the cumbersome data model. Have you ever tried to write a CityGML file? And to parse one? We did, and we didn't like it. Therefore we created a developer-friendly JSON implementation of the CityGML data model. The talk at FOSS4G introduced *CityJSON* its processing software *cjio*, which can be used as a CLI to chain operations, or its API can be used to generate features for machine learning.

The complete material of the presentation is in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/balazsdukai/foss4g2019). The [jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/balazsdukai/foss4g2019/blob/gh-pages/cjio_tutorial.ipynb) contains a step-by-step tutorial on using the current version of *cjio*.
