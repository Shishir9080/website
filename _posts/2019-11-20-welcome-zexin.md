We are excited to be hosting Zexin Yang, a 2nd-year PhD student from Tongji University (Shanghai, China). He is a major in Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, with a B.S. Degree in Surveying and Mapping Engineering from the Guangdong University of Technology (Guangzhou, China). His PhD research focuses on the automatic reconstruction of building models with multiple LoDs from point cloud data.

Zexin will be visiting us for 6 months. During his visit, he will conduct research on urban point cloud semantic segmentation - the first step of his PhD research.

Welcome Zexin!
