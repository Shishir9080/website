On December 2nd and 3rd the [EuroSDR - AMS GeoBIM benchmark workshop](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim-benchmark/events.html) was held at the [Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions](https://www.ams-institute.org/). With over 60 participants it was an educational and collaborative event!

The workshop focused on insight into the GeoBIM benchmark results and explored in detail the related topics:
- 3D city models
- Building Information Models
- Respective open standards (CityGML, CityJSON, IFC, and more)
- GeoBIM use cases (automatic building permission issuing, asset management, energy simulations,etc.)

It was a good opportunity for experts and stakeholders from a diverse amount of backgrounds to meet. Presentation slides and workshop materials will be added to the event [webpage](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim-benchmark/events.html).
