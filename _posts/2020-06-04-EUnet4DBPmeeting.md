On May 29th 2020 the [European network for Digital Building Permits (EUnet4DBP)](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/eunet4dbp/) met for the first time to start working and sharing.

A fruitful brainstorming was done about ambitions, requirements and framing concepts for the digitalization of the building permits, by means of 3D information systems (3D city models, Building Information Models) and more information. The three pillars for the issue were considered: **Technology - Process - Rules and requirements**.

The results will be the solid base to plan activities and next steps.
