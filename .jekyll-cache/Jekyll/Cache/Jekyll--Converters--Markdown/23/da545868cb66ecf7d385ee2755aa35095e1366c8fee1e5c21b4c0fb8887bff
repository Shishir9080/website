	<p>In the week of 20-24 March 2017, together with <a href="http://www.geonovum.nl">Geonovum</a>, we have hosted the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/event/1703tc">Technical and Planning Committee Meeting</a> of the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org">Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)</a>.</p>

<p>The TPC meetings are quarterly conferences in which <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/members">OGC members</a>, which are organised in several working and domain groups, convene to discuss the development of standards and other topics of interest.</p>

<p>The TPC meeting in Delft was very well attended with more than 200 attendees visiting dozens of <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/events/1703tcagenda">sessions</a>. Besides hosting the event, our group was involved in giving presentations in different working and domain groups, such as the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/citygmlswg">CityGML SWG</a> and <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/3dimdwg">3DIM DWG</a>, and our associate professor <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/hledoux/">Dr Hugo Ledoux</a> was the <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/hugoledoux/how-useful-are-current-3d-city-models">keynote speaker of the opening plenary</a>.</p>

<p>The conference was also accompanied by social events. In the traditional Mondayâ€™s Ice Breaker event, the conference attendees were welcomed in the historic Delft City Hall by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marja_van_Bijsterveldt">Mrs Marja van Bijsterveldt</a>, the mayor of the City of Delft and former Minister of Education, Culture and Science in the Dutch Government.</p>
