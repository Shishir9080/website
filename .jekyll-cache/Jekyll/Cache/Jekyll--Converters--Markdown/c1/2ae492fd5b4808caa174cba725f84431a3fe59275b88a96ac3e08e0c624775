<h2 id="description-of-the-position">Description of the position</h2>

<p>We are recruiting an assistant-professor to strengthen and extend our activities on 3D city modelling for urban applications, and connect with the research and education in the wider department. 
Our current research and work encompasses most of the 3D geoinformation chain: 3D data acquisition, processing, analysis, and its use in different applications (e.g. noise and air quality simulations, energy estimation, and safety applications).</p>

<p>The aim of the new position is to extend our research and education on existing applications, as well as finding new, innovative applications for 3D data in different domains related to cities. 
This will require close collaboration with urban/landscape scientists and designers in our faculty, as well as experts in different domains outside the university.</p>

<p>The tasks for this position are to lead on research and education on the innovative use of 3D geoinformation in environmental technology and design, in landscape architecture, and in urban planning and design. 
The appointee will develop education courses and curricula, and teach in areas related to the field of research in the MSc programmes <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/gm/msc-geomatics/">Geomatics</a>, <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/masters/architecture-urbanism-and-building-sciences/msc-architecture-urbanism-and-building-sciences/master-tracks/urbanism/">Urbanism</a>, and <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/masters/architecture-urbanism-and-building-sciences/msc-architecture-urbanism-and-building-sciences/master-tracks/landscape-architecture/">Landscape Architecture</a> at TU Delft, and at <a href="http://www.ams-institute.org">AMS</a>.</p>

<p>The expected starting date is 1 June 2018, or as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="research-group">Research group</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl">3D geoinformation research group</a>, part of the <a href="http://www.bk.tudelft.nl/en">Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment</a> at the <a href="http://www.tudelft.nl">Delft University of Technology</a>, focuses on the technologies underpinning geographical information systems (GIS), and aims at designing, developing, and implementing better systems to model 3D cities, buildings and landscapes.
It is a multidisciplinary group of around <a href="/about/">20 people</a>, including computer scientists, geomatics engineers, and geographers; 3 of them are tenured staff (1 professor, 1 associate-professor, and 1 assistant-professor).
It has a history of successful collaborations with the industry and the government: its research has led to <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d">open source</a> <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d">software</a>, standards, and patents for the management of 3D geographic information.</p>
