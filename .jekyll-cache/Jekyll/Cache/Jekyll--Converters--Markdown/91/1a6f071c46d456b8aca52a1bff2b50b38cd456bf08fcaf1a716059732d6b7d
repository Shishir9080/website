I"l<p>His main research interests are in the field of Geographical Information Systems and spatial data integration, with particular focus on semantic 3D city modelling and their energy-related topics. Some of his research topics deal for example with the development of an information model to manage and exchange semantically-enriched multi-resolution 3D data for urban energy planning. Having a semantic 3D virtual city model as background, the idea is to foster software integration to allow complex urban system simulation and close (or reduce) the gap between geo-information and simulation. He is currently chair of the <a href="http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm4/wg10.html">ISPRS Technical Commission 4 WG 10 (Advanced Geospatial Applications for Smart Cities and Regions)</a> and national representative for Austria of the Urban Data Management Society (UDMS).</p>
