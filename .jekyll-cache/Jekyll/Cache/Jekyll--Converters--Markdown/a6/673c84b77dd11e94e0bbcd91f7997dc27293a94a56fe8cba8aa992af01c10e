<h2 id="efficient-storage-update-and-dissemination-of-massive-3d-city-models">Efficient storage, update and dissemination of massive 3D city models</h2>

<p>The Netherlands has recently launched a <a href="http://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=c2e507c293af4abf9f3add320f537da5">3D map</a> covering the whole country in which all buildings, roads, trees, canals are 3D geometries.
It was constructed by adding the third dimension, obtained from airborne laser-scanners, to the objects in the 2D topographic map (details <a href="http://3dgeoinfo.bk.tudelft.nl/hledoux/pdfs/13_pers.pdf">here</a>).
This leads to a massive amount of information: 15M+ objects, billions of elevation points, and billions of triangles.</p>

<p>The aim of the project is to investigate and develop methods to efficiently store and maintain the dataset in a database, and to disseminate it to practitioners.
The <a href="http://www.3dcitydb.org">existing open-source database solutions</a> for managing 3D volumetric objects will be tested with massive datasets and improved, if necessary.
The biggest challenge is the management of massive TINs (triangulated irregular networks) in a database.
The PhD student will have to design and develop new data structures (eg based on <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~blelloch/papers/BBCK05.pdf">this</a> and <a href="http://3dgeoinfo.bk.tudelft.nl/hledoux/pdfs/13_gsis_pgtet.pdf">that</a>), implement them, and compare different alternatives (in terms of storage space, query time, etc).
Furthermore, a prototype download service that generates 3D datasets tailored to specific applications will be explored, eg <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs">WFS</a> for 3D objects and massive triangulations.</p>

<p>The project will take place in the 3D geoinformation group under the supervision of <a href="http://3dgeoinfo.bk.tudelft.nl/jstoter">Prof. Dr Jantien Stoter</a> and <a href="http://www.tudelft.nl/hledoux">Dr Hugo Ledoux</a>.
It is fully funded by the Dutch Technology Foundation (<a href="http://www.stw.nl">STW</a>), and it is part of a <a href="http://www.3d4em.nl">large project in the Netherlands</a> in which 3 universities and 11 organisations are involved.
We expect the PhD student to collaborate with the other researchers and practitioners involved in the project.</p>

<h2 id="research-group">Research group</h2>

<p>The 3D geoinformation research group, part of the <a href="http://www.bk.tudelft.nl/en">Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment</a>, focuses on the technologies underpinning geographical information systems (GIS), and aims at designing, developing and implementing better systems to model 3D cities, buildings and landscapes.
It is a multidisciplinary group of around <a href="/about/">12 people</a>, including computer scientists, geomatics engineers, and geographers.
It has a history of successful collaborations with the industry and the government: its research has led to <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d">software</a>, standards and patents for the management of 3D geographic information.</p>

<h2 id="doing-a-phd-at-tu-delft">Doing a PhD at TU Delft</h2>

<p>At the Delft University of Technology, a PhD student is a full-time employee of the university who gets paid a salary, no extra funding is necessary.
The gross salary is €2,125 per month for the 1st year, going up to €2,717 during the 4th year.
TU Delft also offers an attractive benefits package, including a flexible work week and the option of assembling a customised compensation and benefits package.
More information about doing a PhD at TU Delft and in the Netherlands can be found <a href="http://www.phd.tudelft.nl">here</a> and <a href="http://www.studyinholland.nl/education-system/degrees/phd">there</a>.</p>

<h2 id="job-requirements">Job requirements</h2>

<p>Applicants should hold an MSc degree (or almost completed) in geoinformatics/geomatics, computer science, applied mathematics, or in a related discipline.
They are expected to have good programming skills, a good command of English (oral and written) and strong interest in 3D modelling and/or computational geometry.
Prior experience with GIS is highly desirable.</p>
