<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Objects of more than three dimensions can be used to model geographic phenomena that occur in space, time and scale.
For instance, a single 4D object can be used to represent the changes in a 3D object’s shape across time or all its optimal representations at various levels of detail.</p>

<p>Higher-dimensional objects can be however unintuitive, and extracting meaningful information from them is a challenge.
This research line aims to solve this problem by developing techniques to extract particular 3D city objects from a 4D model.</p>
