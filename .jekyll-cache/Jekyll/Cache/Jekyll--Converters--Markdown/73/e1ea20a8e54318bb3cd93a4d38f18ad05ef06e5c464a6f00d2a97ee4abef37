<p>Note: Semantics are usually consistently assigned and many attributes are filled.</p>

<p>You can browse the full list of IFC entities, with related descriptions, definitions and foreseen attributes in the <a href="http://standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC2x3/TC1/HTML/">buildingSMART website</a>.</p>

<p>For checking the semantics of the model, <strong>we propose here some elements in a higher detail.</strong></p>

<p>Anyway, we suggest to have an overall look at the model and its elements, and report on them all, including the more general entities <strong>IfcSite</strong> and <strong>IfcBuilding</strong> and <strong>IfcBuildingStoreys</strong>, even if, in this case, they contain very few attributes (namely, only the attribute â€˜NumberOfStoreys = 3â€™ is added to IfcBuilding, and â€˜AboveGround = .U.â€™ to IfcBuildingStoreys).</p>

<h2 id="elements-groups-the-3-storeys">Elements groups: the 3 storeys</h2>

<p>For the Task 1, you should also check that the objects are grouped in the same building storeys.</p>

<p>The grouping of the model is not completely consistent with the definition:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>storey 1 includes the ground floor, some structures rising for the whole building heights and the roof;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>storey 2 includes the first floor of the building, without roof, and the roof of the close building 2-storeys height;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>storey 3 only includes the roof structure. However, we will evaluate the consistency of the model with itself).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>However, we wonâ€™t judge this, only checking that it remains consistent with itself once imported. In the following Figures, we add several images of the single storeys so that you can check visually that no changes have happen, as far as you can. We will eventually go in further detail during the final benchmark analysis using the models delivered by you.</p>

<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>

<p>In Task 1, you are also asked to check other relationships.
Some examples, in the Myran.ifc model are:</p>

<p><strong>IfcRelAssociatesMaterial</strong>, connecting the objects (e.g. IfCWallType or IfCWallStandardCase) to their materials (e.g. IfcMaterialLayerSet, IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage).</p>

<p><strong>IfcRelAggregates</strong>, between one object to others (e.g. IfCurtainWall to IfcMember and IfcWallStandardCase; IfcRoof to IfcSlab; IfcStair to IfcRailing and IfcStairFlight and IfcMemebr, and so on).</p>

<p><strong>IfcRelFillsElement</strong>, between IfcOpeningElement to IfcDoor or IfcWindow.</p>

<p><strong>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</strong>, between IfcBeam and IfcFlowSegment (and many more) to IfcBuildingStorey.</p>
