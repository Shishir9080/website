I"™<p>We were very happyâ€”and surprisedâ€”to see that the <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tjss20/current">Journal of Spatial Science</a> (made by <a href="http://www.csdila.unimelb.edu.au/people/saeid-kalantari-soltanieh.html">Mohsen Kalantari</a>) has published a review of the PhD thesis of <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/ken">Ken Arroyo Ohori</a>, who <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/news/2016/04/07/ken-phd.html">defended earlier this year his PhD work</a> in our group.
Surprised because we do not often see reviews of PhD theses, that section is, we believe, mostly reserved for the review of books.</p>

<p>The review, available <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14498596.2016.1225489">here</a>, is very positive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it pushes the boundary of existing theories in 3D geographic modelling. It brings the knowledge-base of the spatial sciences to a new level. Particularly, the early chapter on conceptualising higher dimensions of geographic phenomena is significant for the spatial sciences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and even states that it could be used as a textbook:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I strongly recommend the book to those who are undertaking research in 3D and spatiotemporal information. Also, the book has the potential to be used as a reference textbook for teaching.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thesis released into the public domain using the CC0 code, and is <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/ken/en/thesis/">freely available online</a>.</p>

<p>For those interested in how it was written (ie the details about LaTeX), Ken wrote a <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/ken/en/2016/04/02/my-latex-thesis-workflow.html">nice blog post</a>.</p>
