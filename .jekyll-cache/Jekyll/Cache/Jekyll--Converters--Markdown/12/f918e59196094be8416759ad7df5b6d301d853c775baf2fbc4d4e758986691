Patrick Janssen has just joined our research group as an external associate-professor.</p>

<p>Patrick is already an associate-professor at the <a href="https://www.arch.nus.edu.sg">Department of Architecture of the National University of Singapore</a>, and this position (for a duration of 5 years) will allow us to strengthen our links with Singapore (where <a href="https://www.nrf.gov.sg/programmes/virtual-singapore">great projects about 3D geoinformation</a> are taking place) and Patrickâ€™s links to the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Welcome Patrick, we hope to see you often in Delft!</p>
