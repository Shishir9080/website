I"e<p>Following the Eurographics Workshop on Urban Data Modelling and Visualisation (UDMV) hosted by our group in Delft in <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/events/udmv2015/">2015</a>, this year we had the pleasure of participating in the new (4th) edition of UDMV.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://events.ulg.ac.be/udmv2016">UDMV 2016</a> was held in Liège, Belgium on 8 December 2016.
It was organised by the <a href="http://www.geo.ulg.ac.be/cms/index.php?page=presentation_unit_fr">Department of Geomatics at the University of Liège</a>.</p>

<p>The workshop was attended by participants from several European countries, and it included the presentations of 14 <a href="http://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/2631130">papers</a>, resulting in fruitful discussions.</p>

<p>Our group continued to be involved in the workshop in different ways: the keynote speaker of the event was Hugo Ledoux, and the programme co-chair was Filip Biljecki.<br /></p>
