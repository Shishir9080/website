I"Z<p>On 30th of September the initiative <a href="http://www.geonovum.nl/onderwerpen/3d-doorbraak">Breakthrough 3D NL</a> organised a 3D symposium in the Infoversum, Groningen, together with the university of Groningen. Jantien Stoter from our group represents science in this initiative. Almost 200 people enjoyed the nice 3D visualisation capabilities of the Infoversum. Many 3D applications in the area of Groningen were presented (like the virtual inventory of hunebedden and Earthquake prediction tools). In addition, several 3DBreakthrough-working groups gave updates about their ambitions and progress. The presentations as well as a short report will soon become available via the <a href="http://www.geonovum.nl/nieuws/inspireer-en-laat-je-inspireren-op-het-3d-doorbraak-symposium-30-september">Geonovum website</a></p>
