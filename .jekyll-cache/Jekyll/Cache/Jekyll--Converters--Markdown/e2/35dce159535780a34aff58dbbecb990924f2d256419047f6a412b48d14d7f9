I"j<p>This week we had the pleasure of hosting the pre-course seminar of the <a href="http://www.eurosdr.net/education/current">2017 series of e-learning courses from EuroSDR</a>. 
During the seminar, 4 lecturers presented on the topics of 3D city modelling (Jantien Stoter &amp; Ravi Peters from our group), oblique photogrammetry (Fabio Remondino), synthetic aperture radar (Olaf Hellwich) and terrestial point clouds for forest modelling (Liang Xinlian).</p>

<p>People from throughout Europe travelled to Delft to attend the lectures. The audience was a mix of academics and people from industry and mapping agencies.</p>

<p>We are very satisfied with how this turned out, and we hope the participants also enjoyed their stay with us.</p>

<p>Starting from next week the e-learning part of the courses will take place.</p>
