Early this year the students were invited by the museum to demonstrate current technologies for 3D reconstructions and realistic visualisation.

In cooperation with the museum six student assignments were defined: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MuseumHetPrinsenhof/videos/vb.393605697333974/1035294739831730/?type=2&amp;theater">Ancient fortifications of the Delft</a>, Realistic visualisation of Paardenmarkt, Walk through the city with Cyclomedia images, Laser scanning of interior of the Prinsenhof, 1654 gunpowder explosion in Minecraft and Prinsenhof in the time.
