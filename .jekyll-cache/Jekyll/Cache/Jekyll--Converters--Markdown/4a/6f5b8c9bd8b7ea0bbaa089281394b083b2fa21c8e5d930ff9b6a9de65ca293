I"u<p>We are pleased to announce our participation in the 2016 series of e-learning courses from EuroSDR. As part of the 4-course program we will be teaching a course on 3D city modelling. The course description reads as follows:</p>

<p><em>This is an introductory course to 3D city modelling. 3D city models are becoming an ubiquitous tool in areas such as urban planning and environmental modelling. This course gives an overview on state- of-the-art in 3D city modelling and its applications, introduces the participants to the underlying principles of 3D city modelling and lets them experience hands-on what it means to create a 3D city model. A number of topics will be discussed: the international CityGML standard, the concept of Level of Detail (LOD) in 3D city models, and the importance of data quality. The goal of the practical exercise, to be executed with FME, is to create a valid and CityGML-compliant LOD1 3D city model by combining existing 2D topographical datasets with aerial LiDAR point clouds.</em></p>

<p>Our course is scheduled between 18-29 April 2016 and is preceeded by a seminar hosted by the University of Warsaw from 7-8 March 2016.</p>
