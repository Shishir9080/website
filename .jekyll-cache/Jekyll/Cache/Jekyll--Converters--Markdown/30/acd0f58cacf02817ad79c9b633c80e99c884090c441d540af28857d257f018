<h2 id="what-is-tested">What is tested</h2>

<p>The <em>Task 2 - Options for georeferencing IFC</em> aims at the description of the <strong>available georeferencing procedures</strong> for IFC inside or outside BIM software tools.</p>

<h3 id="software-performances">Software performances</h3>
<p>Participants <strong>can choose the software or procedure they are more confident with</strong>.</p>

<p>All kinds of software and tools are admitted (off-the shelf software, self-programmed tools, analysis software, and so on).</p>

<p>A list of suggested software is published, together with the already tested ones, in the <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim-benchmark/software.html">software section</a> of this website.</p>

<h3 id="software--hardware-performances">Software + Hardware performances</h3>
<p>A part of the investigation regards also the performances of the software in the used computer. Therefore, as important part of the results, participants are also asked to <strong>check the (approximated) required processing time for each step.</strong>
For these results were not affected by third factors, participants are asked to <strong>close all the unnecessary processes, software and tools in the computer during the test.</strong></p>

<p>Moreover, in ‘Section 3’ of the Results template, participants are asked to report the characteristics of the <strong>used computer.</strong></p>

<p>In the case they need to change computer for different parts of the Task, they are asked to communicate this through e-mail (f.noardo@tudelft.nl). Otherwise, it will be assumed that the computer described at the beginning is used for the whole Task.</p>

<h2 id="summary-of-the-task">Summary of the Task</h2>
<p>The participants should georeference the IFC models according to the parameters described in their respective <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim-benchmark/data.html">data description</a>, in the section ‘Georeferencing details - Georeferencing parameters (for Task 2)’.</p>

<p>In the results they will describe the used procedure and deliver the georeferenced models.</p>

<p>Moreover, a part of the task concerns the test of some functionalities of the software with both the not-georeferenced and the georeferenced data, in order to compare the software performances in the two cases.</p>

<h2 id="what-data-must-be-used">What data must be used</h2>

<p>For performing this task, the following data will be used, in this order:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim-benchmark/ifcmyran.html">Myran IFC model</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim-benchmark/uptown.html">Up:Town IFC model</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim-benchmark/savigliano.html">Savigliano IFC model</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In the case the tested software is not able to manage some of the data, participants can anyway deliver the results concerning the other one.</p>

<p>You will be able to download the data after you fill the <a href="https://francescanoardo.typeform.com/to/IbdpZD">registration form</a>.</p>

<p>And you can find their description, useful to the task, in the <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim-benchmark/data.html">data section</a> of this website.</p>

<p>The <em>Myran</em> and <em>Up:Town</em> IFC models are not open data. Therefore, we ask participants not to use them without permissions outside the project, please.</p>

<h2 id="how-is-the-task-organised-">How is the task organised <!--and how long does it take to perform the task --></h2>
<!--
**The task will require, approximately, <mark>TIME</mark>, to be performed and deliver the required results.** -->

<p>The task can be performed by filling a provided <strong>results template</strong> as web forms (using typeform.com). You can access it and begin your answer in a following section in this webpage.</p>

<p>The results template is organised in 5 sections:</p>

<p><em>Please, note that it is not necessary to fill all the questions if the software doesn’t have the needed functionalities.</em></p>

<p><em>If <strong>processes, settings and any useful further detail is carefully described</strong> while using the Myran.ifc data, it is possible to avoid repeating them, if nothing different has to be reported.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Section 1</strong> - <em>Participant information</em> (This information has already been captured in the <a href="https://francescanoardo.typeform.com/to/IbdpZD">registration form</a>, here we only ask name and e-mail as reference. If something has changed, please communicate it at f.noardo@tudelft.nl).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Section 2</strong> - <em>Tested software/tool</em> (asking details about the tested software)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Section 3</strong> - <em>Computer hardware</em> used (asking details about the used computer for correctly comparing the performances of the different tools)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Section 4</strong> - <em>The Task</em> (guiding the participant through the task). This, in turn, includes:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Test with <strong><em>Myran.ifc</em></strong> data (this will allow the main test of the georeferencing procedure):</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Time performances evaluation with not-georeferenced data, once imported in the software</li>
          <li>Georeferencing procedure</li>
          <li>Same time performances evaluation with georeferenced data</li>
          <li>export functionality</li>
        </ul>

        <p>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Test with <strong><em>UpTown.ifc</em></strong> data (this will add an evaluation of the software performances with bigger data):</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Time performances evaluation with not-georeferenced data, once imported in the software</li>
          <li>Georeferencing procedure (it is part of the task, but the related questions are no more reported in the <em>results template</em>, since it is assumed thay they are the same as described for the test with the <em>Myran.ifc</em> data. In the case different steps or configuration, settings, tools, any details are used, these can be reported in the final <em>‘other comment’</em> and <em>‘attach other files’</em> sections.</li>
          <li>Same time performances evaluation with georeferenced data</li>
          <li>export functionality</li>
        </ul>

        <p>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Test with <strong><em>Savigliano.ifc</em></strong> data (this will allow the main test of the georeferencing procedure with IFC4 data):</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Time performances evaluation with not-georeferenced data, once imported in the software</li>
          <li>Georeferencing procedure</li>
          <li>Same time performances evaluation with georeferenced data</li>
          <li>export functionality</li>
        </ul>

        <p>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Section 5</strong> - <em>Finalisation</em> (participants can deliver eventual further information or comments, agree with the use of data and deliver the processed models, both in native formats and IFC, before submitting their results).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>It is <strong>really recommended to have a look at the whole task before starting.</strong></p>

<p>Participants can have the overall in-sight into the task through reading the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/duhw5fljfbw6ik3/Task2.pdf?dl=0">complete list of questions</a> and having a look at <a href="hhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/74g8shc42via0wz/ExampleTask2_UpdatedForms.pdf?dl=0">an example of submitted template in its most up-to-date format</a>.</p>

<p><em>(Please note that the <strong>online forms are made easier (and up-to-date) to be filled with respect to the word file!</strong>
Our suggestion is to have a look at the whole task here and then do the tests while filling the online form. Thank you).</em></p>

<p><strong>To begin and submit the online forms, an internet connection is needed. However, after it is loaded, no connection is necessary, and the form can stay open for long time, as long as te tab browser stay open (it won’t refresh), so that you can take your time for doing tests.</strong> See <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim-benchmark/faq.html">FAQ</a></p>

<p>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p><strong>Please note that it is not possible to modify the submitted answers. In case this is necessary, you can e-mail the organisers to report the needed changes.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you test more than one software, you should submit one form per software (all of them will be stored and the information won’t be replaced</strong></p>

<h3 id="structure-of-the-online-results-template">Structure of the online results template</h3>

<p>To allow the participants to fill the results template in different times without loosing the previous work, the results template for this task is splitted in 2 parts.</p>

<p>At the end of first part, the link towards the following one will be provided, both in the last slide of the online form, and in an e-mail sent to the indicated e-mail address.</p>

<p><strong>REMEMBER TO SUBMIT EACH PART</strong>, by pushing “Submit” in the online form, before moving to the following part (an e-mail will notify you).</p>

<p>In particular, the 2 parts include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>1/3) ‘Section 1 - Participants information’ to ‘Section 4 - the Task’: test with <em>Myran.ifc</em>’</li>
  <li>2/3) ‘Section 4 - the Task’: test with <em>UpTown.ifc</em></li>
