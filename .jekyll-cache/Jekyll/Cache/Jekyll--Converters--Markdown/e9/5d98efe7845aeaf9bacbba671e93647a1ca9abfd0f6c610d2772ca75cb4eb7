I"<p>On 17 and 18th of June, the 5th project meeting of the EuroSDR GeoBIM project took place at Lund University, Sweden.</p>

<p>In this project, led by Francesca Noardo from our group, 12 Mapping Agencies and 5 research institutes are collaborating to increase the use of geo-data in BIM applications and vice versa. We are currently in the phase of analysing the steps of specific real-world workflows that could be improved by a better combined use of geo-data and BIM data.
The two workflows of our study are the building permit workflow and asset management. 
During the meeting we agreed upon a building permit workflow that reflects the workflow in the participating countries.
In a next step, certain steps of the workflow will be prototyped and from this, data requirements for the involved BIM- and geo-data will be formulated.
For the asset management workflow, the results of a series of interviews with asset management organisations held in the UK were presented. From this, we will draw conclusions how geo-data can improve their workflows.</p>
