Giorgio Agugiaro has joined our research group as an Assistant Professor (tenure track).</p>

<p>He completed in 2002 his studies in environmental engineering at the University of Padova, Italy. He received in 2009 his Ph.D. in Geomatics as a joint doctorate between the Technische Universit√§t Berlin and the University of Padova.
From 2010 till 2014 he worked for the 3D Optical Metrology unit at Bruno Kessler Foundation (FBK) in Trento, Italy. In 2013 he spent 7 months as visiting researcher at the Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen (Germany). Before moving to the Netherlands, he worked 2014-2018 in Vienna at the Austrian Institute of Technology in the Sustainable and Resilient Cities and Regions unit.</p>

<p>His main research interests are in the field of Geographical Information Systems and spatial data integration, with particular focus on semantic 3D city modelling and their energy-related topics. Some of his research topics deal for example with the development of an information model to manage and exchange semantically-enriched multi-resolution 3D data for urban energy planning. Having a semantic 3D virtual city model as background, the idea is to foster software integration to allow complex urban system simulation and close (or reduce) the gap between geo-information and simulation.</p>

<p>He is currently chair of the <a href="http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm4/wg10.html">ISPRS Technical Commission 4 WG 10 (Advanced Geospatial Applications for Smart Cities and Regions)</a> and national representative for Austria of the Urban Data Management Society (UDMS).</p>
