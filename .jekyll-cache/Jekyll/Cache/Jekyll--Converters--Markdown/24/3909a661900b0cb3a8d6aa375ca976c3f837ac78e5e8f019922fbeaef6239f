I"Œ<p>Last week, 25 students from the MSc course ‚ÄúLand administration‚Äù at <a href="http://www.itc.nl">ITC</a> (University of Twente) visited our research group to learn more about 3D cadastre and related topics.
After an overview of 3D cadastre developments in the Netherlands (by Jantien Stoter), Hugo Ledoux presented his work on automatically detecting and repairing errors in 3D data.
Then 3 PhD candidates presented their researches: Ravi Peters about smart processing of LiDAR points, Zhiyong Wang about navigation for first responders of disasters and Liu Liu about semantic modelling to support path-finding.</p>

<p>It was a pleasure for us to welcome this group of international students coming from over twelve countries.</p>
