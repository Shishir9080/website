I"T<p>On the 23rd and 24th March we have organised a PhD seminar with the members of the <a href="https://www.gis.bgu.tum.de/en/home/">Chair of Geoinformatics of the Technical University of Munich</a>.</p>

<p>The aim of the PhD symposium was knowledge exchange between PhD candidates and postdocs in GIS of the two universities, and exploring potential matches in order to join forces on common challenges. In total 25 presentation were given, and a special focus has been put on presenting the software developed at each group.</p>

<p>The event resulted in fruitful discussions based on which multiple research visits between the two universities will be  conducted. We also had an opportunity to test our knowlege in a pub quiz focused on CityGML.</p>

<p>During their stay in Delft, the members of the GIS group from TUM also visited the City of Rotterdam where they had been acquainted with the 3D developments.</p>

<p>We are pleased that all members of the Chair of Geoinformatics from Munich visited us in Delft, and we are looking forward to mutual visits in the future.</p>
