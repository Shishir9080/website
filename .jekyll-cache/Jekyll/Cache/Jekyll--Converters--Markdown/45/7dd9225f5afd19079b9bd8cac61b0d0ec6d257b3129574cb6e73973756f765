Tom Commandeur has recently started as a researcher in our research group. He will be mostly working on our <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d/3dfier">software to construct 3D city models</a>, and will improve it so that we can automatically use it to reconstruct the whole of the Netherlands in 3D.
We aim at having a full 3DBGT datasets in the coming months.
This will be done in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.kadaster.nl">Kadaster</a>.</p>

<p>Tom finalised in the beginning of 2012 a Msc Geomatics at the TU Delft with a <a href="http://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:c0c665f7-0254-42c6-895b-cb59acc079f2/?collection=research">thesis on automated reconstruction of 3D city models</a>. 
Since then he has worked as a Geo-Information specialist and software developer in a commercial company applying HydroInformatics in solutions for the Dutch waterboards.</p>

<p>Welcome Tom!</p>
