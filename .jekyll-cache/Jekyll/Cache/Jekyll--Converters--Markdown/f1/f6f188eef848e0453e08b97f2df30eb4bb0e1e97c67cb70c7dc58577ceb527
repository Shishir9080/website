<p>This paper addresses the issue of handling uncertainties in using hazard simulation to support path planning in the presence of moving obstacles (e.g. plumes). A spatial data model is presented to support representation of the uncertain obstacles generated from hazard simulations. Besides, a modified A* algorithm is proposed for calculation of safe routes for first responders. The proposed data model and the algorithm have been validated with a set of test cases.<br /></p>
