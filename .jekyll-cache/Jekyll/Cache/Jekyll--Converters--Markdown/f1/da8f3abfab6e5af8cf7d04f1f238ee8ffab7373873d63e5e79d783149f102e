I"Ë<p>We presented at the FOSS4G 2019 conference in Bucharest:</p>

<p><strong>Working with 3D city models in Python</strong></p>

<p>Semantic 3D city models are one of the cornerstones of the so-called ‚Äúsmart city‚Äù applications, yet they are very difficult to manipulate/edit/update. While they are relatively easy to generate, their use and maintenance is limited by the available software and the cumbersome data model. Have you ever tried to write a CityGML file? And to parse one? We did, and we didn‚Äôt like it. Therefore we created a developer-friendly JSON implementation of the CityGML data model. The talk at FOSS4G introduced <em>CityJSON</em> its processing software <em>cjio</em>, which can be used as a CLI to chain operations, or its API can be used to generate features for machine learning.</p>

The <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/balazsdukai/foss4g2019/blob/gh-pages/cjio_tutorial.ipynb">jupyter notebook</a> contains a step-by-step tutorial on using the current version of <em>cjio</em>.</p>
