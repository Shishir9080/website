<h2 id="description-of-the-position">Description of the position</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.ams-institute.org/">Amsterdam Institute of Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS)</a> has funded a postdoc position in our research group to integrate data from two main information domains that maintain and collect (3D)data about the built environment: BIM (building information modelling) and Geographic Information (Geo).
The project aims to develop a fundamental solution to integrate models of single  buildings and construction sites (BIM) with models of complete urban areas (Geo). 
The solution will allow us to access BIM data from Geo applications and access geo data in BIM applications.</p>

<p>The task of the postdoc is to analyse the data requirements from a few selected use cases: what data do BIM-professionals need and what data do Geo-professionals need to accommodate the workflows and applications of the use cases? From those data requirement analyses, the postdoc will design and prototype interoperability solutions.</p>

<p>The postdoc does not need to start from scratch. 
Together with users and stakeholders from both domains we have collaborated in a <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geobim/">GeoBIM project in 2017 in which an automated conversion from BIM to Geo was partly developed</a>. 
The postdoc will build on these results and continue our collaboration with national and international stakeholders, with national and international academia and with national and international standardisation bodies.</p>

<p>We are looking for a researcher with a PhD in a field related to 3D Geoinformation (geomatics, geography, computer science, GIS, urbanism, or a comparable subject).</p>

<p>The position is open immediately until filled, and is initially limited to one year.</p>

<h2 id="research-group">Research group</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl">3D geoinformation research group</a>, part of the <a href="http://www.bk.tudelft.nl/en">Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment</a> at the <a href="http://www.tudelft.nl">Delft University of Technology</a>, focuses on the technologies underpinning geographical information systems (GIS), and aims at designing, developing, and implementing better systems to model 3D cities, buildings and landscapes.
It is a multidisciplinary group of around <a href="/about/">20 people</a>, including computer scientists, geomatics engineers, and geographers; 3 of them are tenured staff (1 professor, 1 associate-professor, and 1 assistant-professor).
It has a history of successful collaborations with the industry and the government: its research has led to <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d">open source</a> <a href="https://github.com/tudelft3d">software</a>, standards, and patents for the management of 3D geographic information.</p>

<p>The position is open immediately until filled and is initially limited to one year.</p>
