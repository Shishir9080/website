I"Ô<p>We are happy to host the <a href="https://foss4g.nl/">FOSS4GNL 2019 conference</a>, which is the Dutch Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial Conference held annually.</p>

<p>This year itâ€™ll be at TU Delft (at <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/architecture-and-the-built-environment/about-the-faculty/contact-and-map/">BK-City</a>) on Thursday 20 June 2019.</p>

<p>While many of the talks will be in Dutch, there will always be at least one track (the most technical one) that will be entirely in English.</p>

<p>We invite you to register and you to propose a talk at <a href="https://foss4g.nl/">foss4g.nl</a></p>

<p>See you on 20 June!</p>
