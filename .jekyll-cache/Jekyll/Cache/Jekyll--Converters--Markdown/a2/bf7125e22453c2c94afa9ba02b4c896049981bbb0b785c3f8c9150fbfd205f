I"½<p>Abdoulaye DiakitÃ© (postdoc) and Jinjin Yan (PhD student) have both left our research group recently: they are joining the newly formed group of <a href="https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-sisi-zlatanova">Sisi Zlatanova at UNSW</a> in Sydney, Australia! Abdoulaye will continue as a postdoc, and Jinjin will finish his PhD there.</p>

<p>The best of luck to you both, we hope you wonâ€™t miss the cold rain of Delft too much.</p>
