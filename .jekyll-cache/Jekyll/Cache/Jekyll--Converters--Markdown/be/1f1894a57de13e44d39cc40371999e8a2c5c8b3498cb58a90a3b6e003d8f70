I"Å<p>If you have worked with large GIS datasets, I am sure you will agree: â€™brokenâ€™ polygons are everywhere. Self-touching polygons are often used to represent holes, self-intersecting ones are a common output of generalisation algorithms, and badly nested polygons with holes are interpreted differently in different software.</p>

<p>It might seem like a trivial problem, but it is a more complex than it seems. Whether a polygon is broken or not depends on the polygons themselves, the format they are stored in, your operating system, the libraries you have installed, the software you are using them in, and what you want to do with them.</p>

<p>prepair â€” pronounced â€˜pee-repairâ€™ as in â€˜polygon repairâ€™ â€” solves all possible issues automatically, generating polygons that always conform to the international standards <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=26012">ISO 19107</a> and <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfa">OGC Simple Features</a>. It does so quickly, robustly and without moving any points.</p>

<p>prepair works by computing a constrained triangulation of the polygon using <a href="http://www.cgal.org">CGAL</a>, classifying each triangle as belonging to the interior/exterior, and reconstructing the polygon based on those that were found to be in the interior.</p>
