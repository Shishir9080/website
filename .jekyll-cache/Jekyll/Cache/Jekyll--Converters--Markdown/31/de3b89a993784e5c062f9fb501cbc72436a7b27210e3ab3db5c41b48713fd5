I"Ÿ<p>This is the time of the year when the <a href="http://geomatics.tudelft.nl">MSc Geomatics</a> students are starting their graduation work.
They will work individually on a topic of their choice for 9 months.
This year, weâ€™re glad that several of them (8/14!) have chosen a topic related to 3D geoinformation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Broersen, Tom: <em>Automatic identification of water courses from AHN3</em></li>
  <li>Fichtner, Florian: <em>Subdivision of 3D space to support 3D indoor localization</em></li>
  <li>Heeres, Erik: <em>Creating an automatic, robust and scalable workflow for the creation of the 3D BAG</em></li>
  <li>Kate, Jan ten: <em>Mapping the nuisance caused by music festivals by using 3D modelling</em></li>
  <li>Koopman, Martijn: <em>3D Path-finding in a voxelized model of indoor environments</em></li>
  <li>Nagelkerke, Tim: <em>3D Indoor Navigation: Pursuing individuals in motion</em></li>
  <li>Rodenberg, Olivier: <em>3D navigation using an octree data structure</em></li>
  <li>Rook, Merwin: <em>Automatic thematic and semantic labelling of 3D city models</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Good luck to all of them, and weâ€™ll keep you posted on their progress.</p>
