I"±	<p>I am a full professor in Spatial Data Infrastructure, at the Faculty of Architecture and The Built Environment and I am leading the <a href="http://3d.bk.tudelft.nl">3D GeoInformation</a> group at the Department of <a href="http://www.bk.tudelft.nl/en/about-faculty/departments/urbanism/">Urbanism</a>. I obtained my PhD degree (<a href="http://www.itc.nl/library/Papers_2004/phd/stoter.pdf">3D Cadastre</a>) in 2004. For this work I received the Tienstra award. After my PhD I worked several years at ITC, University of Twente (2004-2009) and led there a research group on ‚Äúautomated generalisation‚Äù. I combine my professorship with jobs as researcher at both the <a href="http://www.kadaster.nl/web/english.htm">Kadaster</a> and <a href="http://www.geonovum.nl">Geonovum</a>. I am chair of the <a href="www.eurosdr.net">EuroSDR</a> 3D Special Interest Group <a href="http://www.eurosdr.net/research/project/eurosdr-special-interest-group-3d-3d-sig">EuroSDR 3D SIG</a>. Since March 2015, I am vice-chair of the Open Geospatial COnsortium 3D Information Management Domain Working Group <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/3dimdwg">(OGC 3DIM DWG)</a>. In December 2016, I became a Principal Investigator at the <a href="http://www.ams-amsterdam.com">Amsterdam Institute of Advanced Metropolitan Solutions</a>
My research interests are 3D, automated generalization and information modelling. For my research on <a href="http://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/projects/geo5d/">5D data modelling</a> I received the prestigious Vidi award of the Netherlands Scientific Foundation (<a href="http://www.nwo.nl/en/research-and-results/programmes/Talent+Scheme/awards/vidi+awards/vidi+awards+2010">NWO</a>). In addition I received a Starting Grant from the European Research Council for my proposal Urban Modelling in higher dimensions (<a href="https://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/erc_2015_stg_results_all_domains.pdf">ERC</a>). I am (co)author of over 350 academic and professional articles and appeared several times in regional and national media. I am a member of the editorial boards of several journals: <a href="http://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-environment-and-urban-systems/">CEUS</a>, the <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/geography/">Geography Journal</a> and the <a href="http://www.irma-international.org/journal/international-journal-information-modeling-ij3dim/41967/">International Journal of 3D Information Modelling</a></p>
