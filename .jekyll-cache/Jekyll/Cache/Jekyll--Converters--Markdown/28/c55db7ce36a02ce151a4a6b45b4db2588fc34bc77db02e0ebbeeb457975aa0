I"¯<p>The <a href="http://singapore.nlembassy.org">Dutch embassy in Singapore</a> organised a working visit for a Dutch delegation consisting of 3D experts from governments, business and academia. The visit took place from 5th of July till 11th of July. <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/jstoter/">Jantien Stoter</a> from the <a href="https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl">3D Geoinformation group</a> participated in the visit (as representative of TU Delft)  and presented at several occasions during the week, one of them being the <a href="http://www.mnd.gov.sg/urbansustainability/smart-technologies.html">R&amp;D congress for sustainable urban environments</a>. The Dutch 3D experts visited many organisations such as A*STAR, University of Technology and Design, National University of Singapore, National Research Foundation, SLA (Singaporean land authority) and the Infocomm Development Authority. Since several years Singapore has launched the Smart Nation innovation programme. This programme seeks to harness ICT, networks and data to support better living, create more opportunities, and to support stronger communities. One of the ambitions of the programme is to build and maintain Virtual Singapore for sustainable urban development. It is evident that both the Smart Nation programme and Virtual Singapore are facing lots of 3D challenges ranging from 3D standardisation and 3D data modelling to the use of 3D in a wide variety of applications to make the city cleaner, safer, better accessible, etc. Initial discussions have started for future collaborations on these issues.</p>
