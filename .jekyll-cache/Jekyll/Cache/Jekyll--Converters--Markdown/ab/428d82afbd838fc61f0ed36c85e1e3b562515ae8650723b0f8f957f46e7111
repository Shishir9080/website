<p>The <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/library/">TU Delft library</a> chose our research group as an example of best practices for publishing software as open-source and papers as open!</p>

<p>They made a <a href="http://www.onlinemagazine.library.tudelft.nl/?p=2060">very nice article</a>.</p>

<p>We are happy that our efforts to make our software and papers freely available were recognised ðŸ˜Š, and we hope itâ€™ll motivate others to imitate us.</p>
