I"‚<p>Last week was the <a href="https://3dgeoinfo2018.nl/">2018 3D GeoInfo Conference</a>, and we had a great week!</p>

<p>We began by hosting the <a href="https://3dgeoinfo2018.nl/workshop.html">pre-conference workshop</a> on the <em>Automated reconstruction of 3D City Models and using them in urban applications</em>. It was a lovely Sunday with a great group of people!</p>

<p>On Monday and Tuesday we joined the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/geodelft2018/">Geo Delft Conferences 2018</a> and helped in organising the 3D GeoInfo Conference with Jantien Stoter, of our group, co-chairing with Mila Koeva from the University of Twente. It was a jam-packed but educational two days.
