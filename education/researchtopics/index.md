## A CityJSON loader for ParaView

![](img/paraview.png){:width="400px"}

Paraview is an open-source, multi-platform data-analysis and visualization application. It is used for the visualization of simulation results in fields such as CFD calculations.

In this research topic, your goal is to develop a loader for CityJSON files in ParaView. You will have to work in the C++ programming language and ParaView's API in order to build a respective reader.
